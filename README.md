# ERP - Point Of Sale - Sistema de Gesti√≥n


This was my first project. It was built mostly with PHP and JavaScript. It was built as a gift for a friend.

It is a multi-user ERP that allows employees to connect and upload their sales. Manage appointments, clients, sales, products, stock, prices and services. It allows
for the administrator to view reports.
